**sbt-example** is an sbt plug-in for creating unit tests from examples in Scaladoc.

The previous version of this project is the macro annotation [`@example`](https://javadoc.io/page/com.thoughtworks.example/unidoc_2.12/2.0.0/com/thoughtworks/example.html), which is [deprecated](https://github.com/scalameta/scalameta/issues/1182) and does not support Scala 2.12.5+ version.

## Showcases

* [AsynchronousPool](https://javadoc.io/page/com.thoughtworks.raii/asynchronous_2.12/latest/com/thoughtworks/raii/AsynchronousPool$.html) - an asynchronous resource pool, whose Scaladoc contains tests written in [ScalaTest](https://scalatest.org/) and [ScalaMock](https://scalamock.org)
* [Factory](https://javadoc.io/page/com.thoughtworks.feature/the_2.12/latest/com/thoughtworks/feature/Factory.html) - a dependent-type type class for dependency injection, whose Scaladoc contains a huge number of small usecases.
* [PartialApply](https://javadoc.io/page/com.thoughtworks.feature/the_2.12/latest/com/thoughtworks/feature/PartialApply.html) - a dependent-type type class for partial applying a function, whose Scaladoc is written in [Given-When-Then](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/GivenWhenThen.html) style.
* [NullSafe](https://javadoc.io/page/com.thoughtworks.dsl/dsl_2.12/latest/com/thoughtworks/dsl/keywords/NullSafe.html) - a library to provide Kotlin / Groovy flavored null-safe `?` operator in Scala.

### Dogfooding

* [Documentation of sbt-example](https://javadoc.io/page/com.thoughtworks.example/sbt-example_2.12_1.0/12/com/thoughtworks/Example$.html) - sbt-example eats its own dog food. The tests of sbt-example are generated by sbt-example itself from Scaladoc, which can be also considered as the documentation for using sbt-example.



## Requirements

* Sbt 1.x
